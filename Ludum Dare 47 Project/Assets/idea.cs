//original game idea
/* puzzle game where you die and use your body to make challenges easier
 * dodging based game where you go around a circle 
 * - spaceship dodging asteroids in an asteroid belt
 * - progressively gets faster
 * - ability to shoot asteroids that get smaller (ala "asteroids") 
 * - upgrades?
 * 
 * 
 * camera controlled by sin/cosine circle
 * player dies if they crash into an asteroid or leaves the camera's pov
 * health system? possibly
 */

 
 //prototype improvements
 /* need a background to orientate urself (done)
  * camera needs a wider radius (done)
  * something happening at different speeds 
  * - screen shaking to signify getting faster? (meh)
  */
